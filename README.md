## Description

An application that allows a company to view their entire employee directory with the employees information. This application uses React, Nodejs and npm packages such as Oxios, React Router and React Tables.

## Challenges

Being my first React project, I found there to be a lot of information to take in at one time. Specific challenges for me were the Axios API and React Tables.
